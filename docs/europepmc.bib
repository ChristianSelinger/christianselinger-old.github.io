These tests are interpreted qualitatively for diagnosis, and the relevance of the test result intensity, i.e. the number of amplification cycles ( C t ), is debated because of strong potential biases. We analyze a national database of tests performed on more than 2 million individuals between January and November 2020. Although we find C t values to vary depending on the testing laboratory or the assay used, we detect strong significant trends with patient age, number of days after symptoms onset, or the state of the epidemic (the temporal reproduction number) at the time of the test.

	Abstract = {Infectious disease transmission patterns in some outbreaks can be more heterogeneous than in others, with striking effects on the way epidemics unfold. Some studies show that the biological sources of heterogeneity may matter, but they tend to do so without controlling for the overall heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases caused by an infection. Here, we control for this important bias to explore the role of individual variation in infection duration and transmission rate on parasite emergence and spread. We simulate outbreaks using a stochastic SIR model, with and without parasite evolution. Consistently with existing studies, we show that the variance in the number of secondary infections has the strongest effect on outbreak emergence probability but has little effect on the epidemic dynamic once emergence is certain. The origin of heterogeneity also affects the probability of emergence, but its more striking effects are about properties of epidemics that do emerge. In particular, assuming more realistic variances in infection duration distributions lead to faster outbreaks and a higher peak of incidence. When the parasite requires evolutionary changes to be able to spread, the impact of heterogeneity depends on the underlying evolutionary model. If the parasite evolves within the host, decreasing the infection duration variance decreases the probability of emergence. These results show that using realistic distributions for infection duration is necessary to accurately capture the effect of individual heterogeneity on epidemiological dynamics, which has implications for the monitoring and control of infectious diseases, as well as data collection.},

Highly prevalent in young, sexually active women, most HPV infections are cleared within 3 years, and only a minority of those infections persist and lead to cancer later in life. To better characterize the immuno-modulatory impact of early HPV infection and more generally perturbations of the cervicovaginal milieu, we measured changes in a panel of 20 cytokines, known as highly dynamic effector molecules implicated in cell signaling. We analyzed 92 cervicovaginal samples collected from young, sexually active women who were tested for or diagnosed with HPV, chlamydia, and bacterial vaginosis. Also, symptoms associated with genital inflammation and infection were collected through self-reporting. Following a parsimonious multi-factor modeling approach, our statistical analyses revealed that increased IL-1Alpha and IL-12/IL-23p40 concentrations were associated with HPV infection. Cytokine network analysis further highlighted the role of IL-1Alpha and macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-3Alpha) in HPV-associated immuno-modulation.},

We investigate HPV prevalence and antibody status in 150 women (ages 18 to 25) in Montpellier, France. At inclusion and one month later, cervical swabs, blood samples and questionnaires (for demographics and behavioural variables) were collected. Oncogenic, non-vaccine genotypes HPV51, HPV66, HPV53, and HPV52 were the most frequently detected viral genotypes overall. Vaccination status, which was well-balanced in the cohort, showed the strongest (protective) effect against HPV infections, with an associated odds ratio for alphapapillomavirus detection of 0.45 (95% confidence interval: [0.22;0.58]). We also identified significant effects of age, number of partners, body mass index, and contraception status on HPV detection and on coinfections. Type-specific IgG serological status was also largely explained by the vaccination status. IgM seropositivity was best explained by HPV detection at inclusion only. Finally, we identify a strong significant effect of vaccination on genotype prevalence, with a striking under-representation of HPV51 in vaccinated women. Variations in HPV prevalence correlate with key demographic and behavioural variables. The cross-protective effect of the vaccine against HPV51 merits further investigation.},

The absence of immunity, asymptomatic transmission, and the relatively high level of virulence of the COVID-19 infection it causes led to a massive flow of patients in intensive care units (ICU). This unprecedented situation calls for rapid and accurate mathematical models to best inform public health policies. We develop an original parsimonious model that accounts for the effect of the age of infection on the natural history of the disease. Analysing the ongoing COVID-19 in France, we estimate the value of the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number , and the efficiency of the national control strategy.

	Abstract = {The structure of host interactions within a population shapes the spread of infectious diseases but contact patterns between hosts are difficult to access. We hypothesised that key properties of these patterns can be inferred by using multiple infections data from individual longitudinal follow-ups. To show this, we simulated multiple infections on a contact network in an unbiased way by implementing a non-Markovian extension of the Gillespie algorithm for a community of parasites spreading on this network. We then analysed the resulting individual infection time series in an original way by introducing the concept of ‘infection barcodes’ to represent the infection history in each host. We find that, depending on infection multiplicity and immunity assumptions, knowledge about the barcode topology makes it possible to recover key properties of the network topology and even of individual nodes. The combination of individual-based simulations and barcode analysis of infection histories opens promising perspectives for the study of infectious disease transmission networks. &lt;h4&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/h4&gt; The way hosts interact with each other is known to shape epidemics spread. However, these interactions are difficult to infer, especially in human populations. Using recent developments in stochastic epidemiological modeling and barcode theory, we show that the diversity of infections each host has undergone over time contains key information about contact network between hosts. This means that longitudinal follow-ups of some individuals in a population can tell us how hosts are in contact with each other. It can also inform us on how connected a particular individual is. This opens new possibilities regarding the use of genetic diversity of infectious diseases in epidemiology.},

Most HPV studies focus on chronic infections and cancers, and we know little about the early stages of the infection. Our main objective is to better understand the course and natural history of cervical HPV infections in healthy, unvaccinated and vaccinated, young women, by characterising the dynamics of various infection-related populations (virus, epithelial cells, vaginal microbiota and immune effectors). Another objective is to analyse HPV diversity within hosts, and in the study population, in relation to co-factors (lifestyle characteristics, vaccination status, vaginal microbiota, human genetics).&lt;h4&gt;Methods and analysis&lt;/h4&gt;The PAPCLEAR study is a single center longitudinal study following 150 women, aged 18-25 years, for up to 2 years. Visits occur every 2 or 4 months (depending on HPV status) during which several variables are measured, such as behaviours (via questionnaires), vaginal pH, HPV presence and viral load (via qPCR), local concentrations of cytokines (via MesoScale Discovery technology) and immune cells (via flow cytometry). Additional analyses are outsourced, such as titration of circulating anti-HPV antibodies, vaginal microbiota sequencing (16S and ITS1 loci) and human genotyping. To increase the statistical power of the epidemiological arm of the study, an additional 150 women are screened cross-sectionally. Finally, to maximise the resolution of the time series, participants are asked to perform weekly self-samples at home. Statistical analyses will involve classical tools in epidemiology, genomics and virus kinetics, and will be performed or coordinated by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Montpellier.&lt;h4&gt;Ethics and dissemination&lt;/h4&gt;This study has been approved by the Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Méditerranée I (reference number 2016-A00712-49); by the Comité Consultatif sur le Traitement de l'Information en matière de Recherche dans le domaine de la Santé (reference number 16.504); by the Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés (reference number MMS/ABD/AR1612278, decision number DR-2016-488) and by the Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé (reference 20160072000007).

An impact of up to 697,000 (11.5%) infections prevented could be achieved by targeting age cohorts of highest incidence. Economic evaluation indicates that, if treatment scale-up was achieved, vaccination could be cost-effective at a total cost of less than $385 and $62 per 10-year series (cost-effectiveness thresholds of $5,691 and $750).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;While a partially effective, rapidly waning vaccine could help to prevent HIV infections, it will not eliminate HIV as a public health priority in sub-Saharan Africa. Vaccination is expected to be most effective under targeted delivery to age groups of highest HIV incidence. Awaiting results of trial, the introduction of vaccination should go in parallel with continued innovation in HIV prevention, including studies to determine the costs of delivery and feasibility and further research into products with greater efficacy and durability.},

	Abstract = {The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of paralytic poliomyelitis by a factor of 10,000 or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is reintroduced after OPV cessation, under what conditions will OPV vaccination be required to interrupt transmission? Can conditions exist in which OPV and WPV reintroduction present similar risks of transmission? To answer these questions, we built a multi-scale mathematical model of infection and transmission calibrated to data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. At the within-host level, the model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and oral susceptibility to infection. At the between-host level, the model emulates the interaction of shedding and oral susceptibility with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the transmission rate in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low transmission rate settings and that OPV can be reintroduced and withdrawn as needed in moderate transmission rate settings. However, in high transmission rate settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. Absent population immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.},

We present an extensive and systematic profiling of lipids, metabolites, and proteins in respiratory compartments of ferrets infected with either 1918 or 2009 human pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses. Integrative analysis of high-throughput omics data with virologic and histopathologic data uncovered relationships between host responses and phenotypic outcomes of viral infection. Proinflammatory lipid precursors in the trachea following 1918 infection correlated with severe tracheal lesions. Using an algorithm to infer cell quantity changes from gene expression data, we found enrichment of distinct T cell subpopulations in the trachea. There was also a predicted increase in inflammatory monocytes in the lung of 1918 virus-infected animals that was sustained throughout infection. This study presents a unique resource to the influenza research community and demonstrates the utility of an integrative systems approach for characterization of lipid metabolism alterations underlying respiratory responses to viruses.},

	Abstract = {&lt;h4&gt;Unlabelled&lt;/h4&gt;The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic remains the single greatest infectious disease outbreak in the past century. Mouse and nonhuman primate infection models have shown that the 1918 virus induces overly aggressive innate and proinflammatory responses. To understand the response to viral infection and the role of individual 1918 genes on the host response to the 1918 virus, we examined reassortant avian viruses nearly identical to the pandemic 1918 virus (1918-like avian virus) carrying either the 1918 hemagglutinin (HA) or PB2 gene. In mice, both genes enhanced 1918-like avian virus replication, but only the mammalian host adaptation of the 1918-like avian virus through reassortment of the 1918 PB2 led to increased lethality. Through the combination of viral genetics and host transcriptional profiling, we provide a multidimensional view of the molecular mechanisms by which the 1918 PB2 gene drives viral pathogenicity. We demonstrate that 1918 PB2 enhances immune and inflammatory responses concomitant with increased cellular infiltration in the lung. We also show for the first time, that 1918 PB2 expression results in the repression of both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for inflammation-mediated lung regeneration and repair. Finally, we utilize regulatory enrichment and network analysis to define the molecular regulators of inflammation, epithelial regeneration, and lung immunopathology that are dysregulated during influenza virus infection. Taken together, our data suggest that while both HA and PB2 are important for viral replication, only 1918 PB2 exacerbates lung damage in mice infected with a reassortant 1918-like avian virus.&lt;h4&gt;Importance&lt;/h4&gt;As viral pathogenesis is determined in part by the host response, understanding the key host molecular driver(s) of virus-mediated disease, in relation to individual viral genes, is a promising approach to host-oriented drug efforts in preventing disease. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of host adaptive genes, HA and PB2, in mediating disease although the mechanisms by which they do so are still poorly understood. Here, we combine viral genetics and host transcriptional profiling to show that although both 1918 HA and 1918 PB2 are important mediators of efficient viral replication, only 1918 PB2 impacts the pathogenicity of an avian influenza virus sharing high homology to the 1918 pandemic influenza virus. We demonstrate that 1918 PB2 enhances deleterious inflammatory responses and the inhibition of regeneration and repair functions coordinated by Wnt signaling in the lungs of infected mice, thereby promoting virus-associated disease.},

	Abstract = {&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus in the Middle East (designated MERS-CoV) is a reminder of the zoonotic and pathogenic potential of emerging coronaviruses in humans. Clinical features of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) include atypical pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure that is highly reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV. The host response is a key component of highly pathogenic respiratory virus infection. Here, we computationally analyzed gene expression changes in a human airway epithelial cell line infected with two genetically distinct MERS-CoV strains obtained from human patients, MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Using topological techniques, including persistence homology and filtered clustering, we performed a comparative transcriptional analysis of human Calu-3 cell host responses to the different MERS-CoV strains, with MERS-CoV Eng 1 inducing early kinetic changes, between 3 and 12 hours post infection, compared to MERS-CoV SA 1. Robust transcriptional changes distinguished the two MERS-CoV strains predominantly at the late time points. Combining statistical analysis of infection and cytokine-stimulated Calu-3 transcriptomics, we identified differential innate responses, including up-regulation of extracellular remodeling genes following MERS-CoV Eng 1 infection and differential pro-inflammatory responses.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Through our genomics-based approach, we found topological differences in the kinetics and magnitude of the host response to MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1, with differential expression of innate immune and pro-inflammatory responsive genes as a result of IFN, TNF and IL-1α signaling. Predicted activation for STAT3 mediating gene expression relevant for epithelial cell-to-cell adherens and junction signaling in MERS-CoV Eng 1 infection suggest that these transcriptional differences may be the result of amino acid differences in viral proteins known to modulate innate immunity during MERS-CoV infection.},

	Abstract = {Using whole-blood transcriptional profiling, we investigated differences in the host response to vaccination and challenge in a rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine trial. Samples were collected from animals prior to and after vaccination with live, irradiated vaccine cells secreting the modified endoplasmic reticulum chaperone gp96-Ig loaded with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) peptides, either alone or in combination with a SIV-gp120 protein boost. Additional samples were collected following multiple low-dose rectal challenges with SIVmac251. Animals in the boosted group had a 73% reduced risk of infection. Surprisingly, few changes in gene expression were observed during the vaccination phase. Focusing on postchallenge comparisons, in particular for protected animals, we identified a host response signature of protection comprised of strong interferon signaling after the first challenge, which then largely abated after further challenges. We also identified a host response signature, comprised of early macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses, in animals with undetectable viral loads 5 days after the first challenge but with unusually high viral titers after subsequent challenges. Statistical analysis showed that prime-boost vaccination significantly lowered the probability of infection in a time-consistent manner throughout several challenges. Given that humoral responses in the prime-boost group were highly significant prechallenge correlates of protection, the strong innate signaling after the first challenge suggests that interferon signaling may enhance vaccine-induced antibody responses and is an important contributor to protection from infection during repeated low-dose exposure to SIV.},

	Abstract = {Over the course of cortical neurogenesis, the transition of progenitors from proliferation to differentiation requires a precise regulation of involved gene networks under varying environmental conditions. In order to identify such regulatory mechanisms, we analyzed microRNA (miRNA) target networks in progenitors during early and late stages of neurogenesis. We found that cyclin D1 is a network hub whose expression is miRNA-dosage sensitive. Experimental validation revealed a feedback regulation between cyclin D1 and its regulating miRNAs miR-20a, miR-20b, and miR-23a. Cyclin D1 induces expression of miR-20a and miR-20b, whereas it represses miR-23a. Inhibition of any of these miRNAs increases the developmental stage-specific mean and dynamic expression range (variance) of cyclin D1 protein in progenitors, leading to reduced neuronal differentiation. Thus, miRNAs establish robustness and stage-specific adaptability to a critical dosage-sensitive gene network during cortical neurogenesis. Understanding such network regulatory mechanisms for key developmental events can provide insights into individual susceptibilities for genetically complex neuropsychiatric disorders.},

	Abstract = {While viral latency remains one of the biggest challenges for successful antiviral therapy, it has also inspired mathematical modelers to develop dynamical system approaches with the aim of predicting the impact of drug efficacy on disease progression and the persistence of latent viral reservoirs. In this review we present several differential equation models and assess their relative success in giving advice to the working clinician and their predictive power for inferring long term viral eradication from short term abatement. Many models predict that there is a considerable likelihood of viral rebound due to continuous reseeding of latent reservoirs. Most mathematical models of HIV latency suffer from being reductionist by ignoring the growing variety of different cell types harboring latent virus, the considerable intercellular delay involved in reactivation, and host-related epigenetic modifications which may alter considerably the dynamical system of immune cell populations.},
